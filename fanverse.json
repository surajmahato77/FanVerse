Well, let me introduce you to Fan verse. And trust me, just like its name, this server gives you the vibe of another family.","Let me tell you how I stumbled upon it and ended up staying forever.","I first joined Discord during the COVID lockdown days. Being away from home for my graduation was tough, and when the pandemic hit, I was stuck far from my family with no choice but to cope alone.","That’s when I discovered my love for writing and started penning down poetry. Discord became my escape—a place where I could recite my poems and find some connection during those lonely times.","But life moved on, right? The lockdown ended, I got busy with my studies, graduated, got a job—and Discord kind of faded into the background. I thought those days were behind me.","Fast forward to October 2024. I decided to change jobs and had a week of free time before starting my new role. On a whim, I reinstalled Discord, hoping to reconnect with my poetry days. But every server I used to visit was dead.","Disheartened, I started searching for active Indian servers for Hindi poetry. That’s when Fan verse popped up.","From the very first conversation,","I felt something different—it felt warm, welcoming, just like home.","Later that night, I hopped into a voice channel, and they welcomed me like family. No awkwardness, just pure, genuine connection.","Even after joining my new job, despite a hectic schedule, I kept coming back every night. I thought I’d stick around for a week, but here I am, still showing up.","Why? Because this place? It became my second home.","So, here’s my advice: join Fan verse. Give it a week. Who knows? You might find yourself staying forever too.","After all, sometimes the connections we stumble upon are the ones we never knew we needed.","Looking for a place to belong?
